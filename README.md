# Rbx Gui Library

Rbx Gui Library is a library designed to help create a few common UI components that are not currently present on the Roblox platform.

The library is designed around two principles:

1. It should attempt to seamlessly integrate into standard Roblox Lua UI programming. There are no complex frameworks or big setups, this should feel familiar like using built-in UI objects.
2. The style of the components should be easy to change so that developers can have functionality without having to sacrafice artistic direction.

Currently GuiLib provides support for:

* Checkbox Labels
* RadioButton Groups
* Text Input Masking
* Sliders
* Dropdown Lists
* Scrolling Lists
* Radial Menu

To see documentation for each class/constructor please read the individual module.
